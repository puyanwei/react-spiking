## React Spiking

This is following the tutorial from Dev Coffee [here](https://youtu.be/ZnRFerIP8aA).

Instead of using CodePen, I tried to setup React myself using the ReactJS [docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The tutorial looks at four things to start out;

1. Props - A custom property of the component that is passed in and reusable.
2. Style - Styling within the ESX (kinda like HTML) has slightly different syntax
3. className - The keyword Class is reserved for React, so to avoid confusion in for this tag className is used instead.
4. State - Like props, it contains properties that are only available to the Class. However, if it is changed it will update and render the DOM automatically live on the fly.

I may adopt other tutorials and or add my own things later.

### Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:puyanwei/react-spiking.git
cd react-spiking
npm install
npm start
```

This will show a webpage with colors toggling.
